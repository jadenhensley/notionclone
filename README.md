# What is it?
Notion-like app with terminal commands input, designed towards daily productivity and one simple interface for logging data, or taking notes, as I go aobut my life or work on other coding projects.

* *first working prototype, including GUI made in 22 Hours*

# Added in recent update:
* fullscreen, hotkey commands
* new backgrounds
* now using SQL database
* GUI now has mulitple tabs/viewports to switch between
* cleaned up interface

# Why is it?
* I find it irritable to use Notion's GUI to manually input things, rather than using a library/module and terminal commands that I can interface with more efficiently, via CLI or scripting. 
* I'd like to customize my GUI to personal preference, i.e. different themes, widgets, trackers.
* I have observed that I really only use the same few templates for logging the same data, and this can be automated in a simpler way by building my own application, under which I also understand the underlying processes that are being used.
* Tools such as Notion do not allow access to your data from their API, I'd rather use my own software that serves as one interface to the data and integrates all these tools under my personal workflow.
* As a developer, I can interface from this tool with other programs I write, or via the terminal screen whether I am in my IDE, or remote-shelling. This builds upon the previous points that I have more direct access to my data, and am often doing coding projects in which I use Notion.
* ***i.e. I am able to simplify the process.***

# Features
* Customizable theme / interface
* Inspirational quotes in banner
* Weather widgets
* Command Line Interface
* Command Line Arguments
* VIM-like Editor, with advantages that come with GUI and markdown.
* Don't have to scroll or use templates, just use one screen, one terminal, etc.


# What I learned

* GUI with Tkinter library
* Saving and loading data
* Terminal program with command line arguments
* Interfacing with API
* Formatting images
* Loading (theme) variables from json
* Building an Object-Oriented Program from scratch, *including the following steps*:
  *  prototyping the program's design
  *  designing the program's interface
  *  coding said program from the ground up
  *  NOT using any project-tutorials!
